# Assessment Rubrics

**\*\*DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE\*\***

The rubrics below will be used in alignment with [AQF Level 9](https://www.aqf.edu.au/framework/aqf-levels#toc-aqf-level-9-criteria-2) in which a students needs to demonstrate that they have achieved _"specialised knowledge and skills for research, and/or professional practice and/or further learning."_ and ability to "_interpret and transmit knowledge, skills and ideas to specialist and non-specialist audiences_".

The rubrics below are holistic in nature with the aim to give an indication of the different quality levels for the various components. The descriptions and aspects are not to be used as ``bean counting" and may not be complete. Therefore, the assessments will not be graded point by point by the various items/aspects listed; it will be graded for its overall quality under the _academic judgment_ of the teacher.

## 1. Project proposal

The proposal has a low weighting but it is still an important document as it will have a big impact on the following two submissions: report and video. A poor or unclear proposal will make it more difficult to carry out a solid project. A clear and well-defined proposal will ease the execution of the project.

Some of the aspects to be considered in a proposal are:

- A clear and specific topic that is worth learning in the context of the course: _what is the topic/problem to be explored and why it is interesting?_
- Clear set of learning objectives to be achieved with the project: _what do we expect to be "expert" on after the project is concluded?_
- A reasonable, not too many, not too few, set of reference material to be used (e.g., papers and reports, user manuals, books, code, benchmarks, etc.): _what (initial) sources will we use to execute the project?_
- A realistic and ambitious schedule plan to execute the project: _what are the tasks and aims for each week of work?_

## 2. Project report

The following rubric is used to mark report/essay questions and is an adaptation and extension of that from Dr. [Sarah-marie Belcastro's rubirc](http://www.toroidalsnark.net/rubpfs.html) for assessing proofs.

The categories used are _general_. Not every statement in a description will apply to a given report marked with a particular category, but the general theme of the category will hold.

In general, we look for the following in a report/essay:

- A **complete**, **correct**, and **deep enough** coverage of the project's topic.
- A **readable (and enjoyable!) exposition**. The grader will make a reasonable and a good faith effort to understand the answer provided. However, it is up to the students to produce an essay or report that is easily readable. A good report should be easy to read and enjoyable by a human being who did not write it.
  - So, the quality of writing will impact the marking in two ways. First, a poorly
written report will have more changes of not being understood and judged incorrect, with flaws or gaps. Second, quality of presentation is part of the marking decision explicitly.

Although the grading is loosely based on the idea of ‘how much of the content’ there is, more is not better when it comes to the character count. A good coverage of the topic should be one that can be read easily and something is learnt beyond the obvious.

This means that each sentence has a coherent purpose, the report does not meander, interesting and non-trivial aspects are discussed and appropriate details are
included. Report should have high-quality grammar, punctuation, and spelling, and use technical language. Fluff should be removed (e.g. ‘and thus we are done’), as well as informal worlds or sentences.

- **[LEVEL 4 - HD/DI]** **The report is deep, complete, and flows well**. The presentation uses correct grammar, English, technical notation/language, figures/tables, etc. The structure of the report is apparent and the bulk of the details are easy to follow (even for a fellow student). The report discusses on all, or almost all, the technical aspects of the topic. No core information is missing, and also no details are over discussed. Adequate referencing is included in a uniform and clear manner. Accompanying support code and experiments are clearly provided. The report may be elegant, but may also contain very minor flaws. A _potential reader_ will know quite a lot about the topic after reading the report, all ingredients are there and there will be no need to look elsewhere for more information.

- **[Level 3 - CR]** **The report is nearly correct/comprehensive/logically coherent.** The reader is required to fill in some details that should have been explained or elaborated further. There may be some explanations, arguments, or justifications that are correct but unclear, brief, cumbersome, needlessly complicated, or awkward. The report can be read well and presentation is appropriate, with few errors or difficulties for the reader. Referencing is included, but may miss some, have too many, or not done clearly and in a uniform manner. Figures and tables can be understood, but they can be improved. The report covers the content at acceptable depth, but deeper coverage could have been achieved within the task for a more more significant understanding. Accompanying support code and experiments are provided, but may have gaps, be unclear, or cumbersome to understand/use. A _potential reader_ will get most about the topic covered by the report, though she/he may benefit from reading some complementary material elsewhere to fill some gaps.

- **[Level 2 - PA]** **The report covers the topic at acceptable level, but has gaps in the content or a significant aspects are not present or hard to follow. OR the technical content might be correct, but this is not demonstrated by the presentation of the report}**. The report can be read, but requires a generous reader. There may be important technical aspects missing or incorrect, or irrelevant content may have been included. There could be non-minor flaws in the presentation. Structure may be confusing, flow may not be enjoyable, English may have important flaws, or figures/tables need improvement. The report covers some non-trivial aspects of the topic, but it lacks depth and substance to get a good understanding. While referencing is included, its coverage and quality needs improvement (e.g., too few, too many, non-uniform, irrelevant, etc.). Accompanying support code and experiments are provided, but they would need significant work to bring it to a high-quality level. A _potential reader_ can get some information about the topic, but not as much to avoid searching elsewhere.

- **[Level 1 - NN]** **The bulk of the assigned report is not present**. The report contains serious logical flaws, and lacks adequate justification or explanation. There may be significant issues with presentation, structure, flow or English, that significantly hinder communication of reasoning. There is little understanding of the topic covered. Explanations present are significantly flawed or unclear. Poor use of figures or tables. No structure is apparent in the report. There is little depth in the content and little evidence there is a deep understanding of the content. A _potential reader_ can get minimal information about the topic, but will definitively need to look somewhere else to understand it well.

- **[Level 0 - NN]** The essay is missing. OR, The essay makes no sense or is unrelated to the assigned task.

Being a written document reporting and reflecting on the investigation carried out on the topic of concern, the report can also be analysed (excellent, very good, good, adequate, insufficient/inadequate) on the following criteria:

**Presentation**

- The purpose and focus are clear and consistent.
- The main claim is clear, significant, and challenging.
- Organization is purposeful, effective, and appropriate.
- Sentence form and word choice are varied and appropriate.- Punctuation, grammar, spelling, and mechanics/flow are appropriate.

**Content**

- Information and evidence are accurate, appropriate, and integrated effectively.
- Claims and ideas are supported and elaborated.
- Alternative perspectives are carefully considered and represented

**Thinking**

- Connections between and among ideas are made. 
- Analysis/synthesis/evaluation/interpretation are effective and consistent.
- Independent thinking is evident.
- Creativity/originality is evident

## 3. Video presentation

The same above general principles apply for the video. A video presentation is assessed based on how 1) **complete**, **correct**, and **deep** the material is covered; and 2) how **viewable (and enjoyable!)** the exposition is.

- **[Level 4 - HD/DI]**. The presentation was very easy to follow and enjoyable. The speaking was excellent or very good, it was easy and enjoyable to follow, with very few mistakes in vocabulary, grammar, or the clarity of the utterances. The presenter clearly understood the topic in-depth and presented his/her information convincingly. All or almost all the information presented was clear, accurate, precise, and thorough. The depth of the content covered was at the right level for a video presentation, focusing on the relevant aspects for the viewer to understand the key points.

- **[Level 3 - CR]**. The presentation was easy to follow. The speaking was good and easy to follow, even if it had some issues with vocabulary, grammar, volume, or the clarity of the utterances. The presenter seemed to understand the main points of the topic and presented those with ease.  Most information presented was clear, accurate, precise, and thorough. The depth of the content covered was generally good for a video presentation, but may have been too detailed or too abstract in some places.

- **[Level 2 - PA]**. The presentation could be followed but it was not easy and required additional effort from the audience. The speaking was acceptable but required extra effort from the viewer hard (e.g., there were issues with vocabulary, grammar, volume, or the clarity of the utterances). The presenter seemed to understood most aspects of the topic and presented his/her information at an adequate level. Most information presented was clear, but was not usually accurate or precise. The depth of the content covered was adequate for a video presentation, but was too detailed or too abstract in many places. There may have been information that was not needed for a presentation or missing information that should have been there.

- **[Level 1 - NN]**. The presentation was difficult to follow (due to, e.g., disorganization of the utterances, structure of the presentation, flow, etc.). The speaking was hard to understand (e.g., due to incorrect use of vocabulary or  grammar, volume, or clarity of the utterances). The presenter did not show an adequate understanding of the topic. A significant amount of the information was inaccurate or not clear. The depth of the content covered was generally inadequate for a video presentation, providing too much details or too few in many places, discussing irrelevant content or missing relevant one.

- **[Level 0 - NN]**. The presentation was missing, irrelevant, or of very poor quality overall.
