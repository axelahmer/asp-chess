-------------------

In this project assessment you are to submit a **team report** and **individual video** presentations on a topic/problem relevant to what has been covered in the course.

You are to select your topic/problem/domain that you would like to investigate and learn about. In doing so, you are expected to seek and read the relevant literature (e.g., scientific papers, manuals, technical reports, etc.), develop the necessary code, run and analyse experiments, integrate the content and findings, and report it, both written and orally.

The overarching aim of this project is that you go _deep_ on a topic or problem and you are able to communicate the learning and results achieved both written and orally.

The project will be composed of three submissions: proposal, report, and video. Each component is be explained below. When in doubt, please ask the teaching staff in advance. Rubrics for the components can be found in file [`RUBRICS.md`](RURBICS.md).

From time to time, students or staff find errors (e.g., typos, unclear instructions, etc.) in the assessment specification or points for further clarification. In that case, a corrected version of this or other files provided will be produced and pushed into your repository.  Because of that, you are **NOT to modify this specification file or the rubric file in any way** to avoid conflicts. However, you can, and most probably will, create your own folders where you can save all the relevant material for the project, including code, relevant papers, experimental data and results, source code of report, etc. Material or resources outside this repo and not freely available via a link will not be considered.

## 1. Project proposal

At the start, the team will hand-in a 2-3 page research proposal PDF document, explaining the topic of the research project to be carried out, the relevant literature/sources to be used (although in the process more sources will be found and used), and a schedule plan that will be followed until report submission. 

The PDF proposal is to be committed and push into the `main` branch of this GitHub repository as a file `proposal.pdf` and the corresponding commit tag (see above).

Each group will then have a discussion with the instructor in Week 7's workshop. It is mandatory each member of the team attends this meeting face-to-face.

### Possible topics/areas/problems

Here is a general list of potential projects:

- University timetabling (check [here](https://www.itc2019.org/home)).
- Sport timetabling (check [here](https://www.sportscheduling.ugent.be/Research/indoor.php)).
- University student course selection and program planning.
- CLINGO algorithms & techniques.
- e.g., no-good learning, multi-shot problems, optimisation, etc..
- Automated Planning via ASP.
- Constraint Logic Programming (SWI-Prolog + Constraints).
- Compare CLP with ASP.
- Agents in City agent coordination: pickup items.
- Map coloring systems.
- _... your project or idea here ..._.

## 2. Project report

The report itself will be due at the end of Week 12 and will be the main output of the assessment. The report should be a file named `report.pdf` and the commit should be done in the `main` branch with corresponding tag (see above).

The report is a technical one, and besides using correct spelling and grammar, it should use adequate academic technical language and style, similar to academic books or papers. Stay away from informal English or subjective claims.

The report should be no more than 20 pages with font no smaller than 11pt.

## 3. Project video

Finally, a 10' individual video presentation is to be submitted. Each student is to submit their own presentation.

The video should be self-contained and cover the whole project carried out by all the members. This means that every student is meant to have a good understanding of the overall project, not just of a part of it. A student can put more emphasis on a given part of the project, but it also has to demonstrate knowledge of the other parts as well.

Each student video should be made available as an [unlisted video](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) in YouTube and embedded in a file `VIDEO_<student no>.md` using the template file [`VIDEO_XYZ.md`](VIDEO_XYZ.md) provided. Tag the commit in `main` branch with the corresponding tag as above.

## Academic Integrity

This is an advanced course, so we expect full professionalism and ethical conduct.  Plagiarism, or just cheating, is a serious offense. Please **don't let us down and risk our trust**.

The whole project and its output, report, video, code, should be the student's own work and appropriate acknowledgment should be given when taking material from elsewhere. For more information on this see [RMIT Academic Integrity](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/my-course/assessment-results/academic-integrity) and/or my explanation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AQAU7cH9zgsneTAfig-afBoVfPCi6t1k2nBzFfhdBfc/edit#heading=h.dkgbjt4yqxxm). And, again, always ask if in doubt and we will help out!

### Course Code of Honour & Fair Play

We expect every RMIT student taking this course to adhere to the **Course Code of Honour** under which every learner-student should:

* Submit their own original work.
* Do not share answers with others.
* Report suspected violations.
* Not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve their results or dishonestly improve or damage the results of others.

If you are in doubt of whether something would break the good spirit of the project, you must check with us early, not wait until it is too late.

## Conclusions

This is the end of the project assessment specification.

If you still have doubts about the project and/or this specification do not hesitate asking me the [Course EdStem Discussion Forum](https://edstem.org/au/courses/8117/discussion/) and I will try to address it as quickly as we can. Remember I am here to help you learn!

**I very much hope you enjoy the project and new learn much from it!**

**GOOD LUCK & ENJOY IT!**

Sebastian
