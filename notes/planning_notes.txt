STRIPS planning involve:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Research_Institute_Problem_Solver

fluents (things that will change):
    - the move predicate
    - potentially the chessman predicate for all T? (placing pieces on the board)

inital and goal state:
    initial state:
        T=1, chessman predicate (position of pieces at T=1, i.e. some starting configuration).
        whos turn is it?
        en passant?
    
    goal state:
        checkmate at some T=N?

set of actions, consistion of pre- and postconditions:
    - preconditions tell us when an action is applicable.
        when a move can be made
            does T-1 have to be fully defined before the move from T-1 to T can be made?
            perhaps better to just restrict that the moving piece must be at the prev location,
                and can move to the destination. (not the whole board being fixed) 
    - postconditions tell us about the effects on an action.
        poscondition for a move at time T means the board position at T+1 is fully defined?

number k of allowed actions:
    all the moves for pieces of the correct color currently on the board.


additional notes:
we likely want to bound time(1..k), then try to find the minimum soln to getting checkmate from making a series of moves.
